This project provides custom implementations of core data structures in Java: MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap. Each structure supports common operations like add, remove, get, push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, insert, and extractMin.

MyArrayList: An array-based list with dynamic resizing.
MyLinkedList: A doubly linked list supporting operations at both ends.
MyStack: A stack implementing LIFO (Last In, First Out) using MyArrayList.
MyQueue: A queue implementing FIFO (First In, First Out) using MyLinkedList.
MyMinHeap: A binary heap that always keeps the smallest element at the root.
